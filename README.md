A set of recommended OS and tooling configurations for Nau team.

SublimeText
-------------
Our conventional IDE for Front End development is SubLime Text 3.
Inside this folders are predefined snippets and settings for it:

### JavaScript
The files in this folder can be classified into these categories:

#### Completions Files:
Sublime Text [completions files](http://sublime-text-unofficial-documentation.readthedocs.org/en/latest/reference/completions.html) (.sublime-completions) are dictionaries that keep a set of auto completion texts. 

- __JavaScript.sublime-completions__: Auto completions for vanilla JavaScript language
    Note: We are considering the ST package __JavaScript Completions__ to replace this completion file.
- __jQuery.sublime-completions__: Auto completions for jQuery API

#### Snippets:
[Snippets](http://sublime-text-unofficial-documentation.readthedocs.org/en/latest/extensibility/snippets.html) are like completion files but they deal with single entry and have higher priority when displayed in the completion list.

Some remarkable snippets:

- __console.log()__: Trigger by typing `log`; after it completes the text, you have the chance to switch to `console.info()` or `console.warn()` or `console.error()` by typing the first letter of the method, respectively __i, w, e__
- __[IIFE](http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/) block__: Trigger `iife`; complete the "immediately invoked function expression" block.
- __[JSHint](http://jshint.com/) by-project config__: Trigger by `jshintrc` in new text file; it will complete the file with Nau's conventional linting rules for JavaScript. Save it to the root of the project.
- __[JSCS](http://jscs.info/) coding style config__: Trigger by `jscsrc` in new text file; it will complete the file with Nau's coding style rules for JavaScript. Save it to the root of the project.
- __[RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/docs/api.html#cjsmodule) Module with Simplified CommonJS Wrapper__: Trigger by `define`. This is our recommended AMD syntax where the dependencies are imported by a `require` function which makes it similar to NodeJS modules and a convenience to add / remove dependencies.

Please check out other snippets in the folder to learn what's available.
